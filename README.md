# Public-Welfare-Schemes

The **Public-Welfare-Schemes** app is designed to connect local governments and citizens by making it easy to access and apply for public welfare schemes. The app provides a list of available schemes, details on the required documents, and allows citizens to apply directly. It also enables government officers to process these applications efficiently. Users can track their application status in real-time, enhancing transparency and accountability.

## Existing Solutions and Our Innovation

Current apps often lack user-friendliness and real-time tracking. While technologies like blockchain and AI have been considered for improving transparency, they are rarely used in local government apps. Our app combines detailed scheme information, an easy-to-use interface, and real-time tracking to fill these gaps.

## How We Plan to Solve the Problem

We will create a user-friendly app using modern design principles. A centralized database will store welfare scheme information and link to citizen data. Our backend will support real-time tracking, and blockchain will ensure data security. Machine learning will help speed up application processing. We'll continuously improve the app based on user feedback.
